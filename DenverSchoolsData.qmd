## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

path <- "C://Users//Mike D//Desktop//Assessment Data//"
math23file <- "2023 CMAS Math District and School Disaggregated  Achievement Results.xlsx" 
eng23file <- "2023 CMAS ELA District and School Disaggregated Achievement Results.xlsx"
math22file <- "2022 CMAS Math School and District Achievement Results - Disaggregated by Group.xlsx"
eng22file <- "2022 CMAS ELA School and District Achievement Results - Disaggregated by Group.xlsx"
math21file <- "2021 CMAS Math District and School Achievement Results Disaggregated by Subgroups - Required Tests.xlsx"
eng21file <- "2021 CMAS ELA District and School Achievement Results Disaggregated by Subgroups - Required Tests.xlsx"

# note that I may need the summary for all. this is only the various subgroups
mathRace23 <- read_excel(paste0(path, math23file), skip=12, sheet="Race Ethnicity") %>%
  rename(District='District Name', 
    DistrictCode='District Code',
    School='School Name',
    SchoolCode='School Code',
    Race='Race/Ethnicity',
    Records='Number of Total Records',
    ValidScores='Number of Valid Scores',
    NoScores='Number of No Scores',
    ParticipationRate='Participation Rate',
    MeanScale
    ) %>%
  filter(District=="Denver County 1", School!="All Schools") %>%
  mutate(Subject=="Math", FRL=="NA")

engRace23 <- read_excel(paste0(path, eng23file), skip=12, sheet="Race Ethnicity")


mathFRL23 <- read_excel(paste0(path, math23file), skip=13, sheet="Free Reduced Lunch")

engFRL23 <- read_excel(paste0(path, eng23file), skip=12, sheet="Free Reduced Lunch")



```

```{r}
#| name: Plot

plot1 <- ggplot(goo2 %>% filter(Grade %in% c("Grade 03","Grade 04","Grade 05")), aes(x=Year, y=MeanScore, color=Subject)) +
  facet_grid(~Grade) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=MeanScore), color="black", fill="black", data=goo2%>%filter(School=="DENVER COUNTY 1 (0880): STECK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (8222)")) +
    geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=MeanScore), color="yellow", fill="black", data=goo2%>%filter(School=="DENVER COUNTY 1 (0880): MC KINLEY-THATCHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (5702)"))

plot1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
