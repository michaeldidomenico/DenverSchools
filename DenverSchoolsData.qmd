## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)

math22file <- "2022 CMAS Math School and District Achievement Results - Disaggregated by Group.xlsx"

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
